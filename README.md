<h2 align="center"> About me </h2>
<p align="center">
  <samp>Bachelor of the Computer Engineering program. While studying, I gained a thorough
understanding of a variety of programming language and industry standards. I am looking
forward to becoming a backend developer in the future as part of my career goals. For my engineer thesis I created a mobile application for tracking fitness training progress, written for Android. To achieve wanted results during work on the app, I used use
MVVM pattern and the Kotlin programming language.
